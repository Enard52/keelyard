# "lazy" sends only read_file, run_compact, find_symbol, proof_status plus tool_search/tool_call (about 60%
# fewer schema tokens than "core"); every other tool is found and run on demand. It falls back to "core"

`.keelyard/` also holds snapshots (`shadow.git`, `steps.jsonl`), proof bundles, shortened outputs (`raw/`)
and the hook error log (`hook.log`). The folder contains a `.gitignore` with `*`, so it is never committed.

Environment variables:

| variable | effect |
|---|---|
| `KEELYARD_ROOT` | use this folder as the project root instead of searching upward for `.keelyard` or `.git` |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME` | where the memory index lives (default `~/.local/share/keelyard`) |
| `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR=0` | plain terminal output |
